This client-server program is to illustrate, how we can use select system call
to serve more than one client at a time by a server.

select() and pselect() allow a program to monitor multiple file descriptors,
waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready" for some class
of I/O operation (e.g., input possible).

A file descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform a
corresponding  I/O  operation without blocking.
