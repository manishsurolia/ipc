Data Synchronization - IPC Project part 1

This project is to create a client-server process model, where server process is
responsible for creating/updating routing table, and updating the same to the
other connected clients processes.

We can call the server process as "Routing Table Manager" (RTM) process and all
other processes are client processes.
