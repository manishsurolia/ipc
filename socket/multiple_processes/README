This program is just a server and client program to show how sockets can be used
between multiple processes in the same linux device to communicate with each
other.

One thing to note here, is that, this server serves only one client reqeust at a
time and not multiple requests.

For serving multiple requests at a time, there will be another program, which
will use 'select' system call.
