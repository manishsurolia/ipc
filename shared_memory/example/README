This simple program is to illustrate how to open a shared memory and map it with
the process.

To open shared memory, use shm_open, this will return a file descriptor and
this file descriptor we can use with mmap to associate this file descriptor
memory with the process.

We can also use a file descriptor of a file with mmap, to associate this
file memory with the process.
