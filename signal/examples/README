signals :

    - SIGINT (can be handled in program)
    - SIGTERM (can be handled in program)
    - SIGKILL (can't handle in program).
    - SIGSTOP (signal to stop)
    - SIGCONT (signal to continue)
    - SIGUSR1 (user defined signal1)
    - SIGUSR2 (user defined signal2)
    - SIGSEGV (signal on segmentation fault).

In linux, macos(unix based OS), we may be using signals but we are not aware of
it.

for example, when we press control-c on a running process, the process stops
running.

its a type of signal we are sending to the process through OS.

lets look and example(example1.c)

let's say I have a program(example1.c) which never terminates. it just goes
forever after it starts the execution.

when you run this program, it runs for sometime and when you try to kill it
using control-c, you are sending a signal to this process to kill it. This
signal is called SIGINT. It just terminates the program.

[ ] gcc example1.c 
[ ] ./a.out 
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5933
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5933
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5933
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5933
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5933
^C
[ ]

Above is a very basic example of a signal. 

============================================
Now, Let's try to see, whether we can catch this signal inside a process and
change this behaviour?

Just add a system call 'signal' to the main program(example2.c) to handle the
SIGINT and print something as below(I won't die!).

now, if you compile and run the program, it will just handle this control-c and
just print this message and wont do anything else. you need to stop this process
from outside with this command (kill -TERM 5981).

[ ] gcc example2.c 
[ ] ./a.out 
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5981
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5981
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5981
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 5981
^CI won't die!

Terminated

Here, we have killed the process, but sending a termination signal. 

============================================
Now, lets try to see whether we can handle the 'SIGTERM' signal also or not?

After starting the program(example3.c) as below:
    - first try with 'control-c' , it does not stop.
    - second try with 'kill -TERM 2420' from other terminal. it again does not
        stop, because now we have handeled SIGTERM also in the program.
    - Now, to stop it, try 'kill -9 2420'. this will kill the process. This
        time you are sending 'SIGKILL' signal to the process. Now, you can not
        handle 'SIGKILL' in your process, because OS does not allow you to do
        so.

[ ] gcc example3.c 
[ ] ./a.out 
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2420
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2420
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2420
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2420

Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2420
I won't die!
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2420
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2420
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2420
Killed

Note : You can handle 'SIGKILL' in your process any time.

lets try to write code for that and check it out.

============================================
with example4.c, I have added code to handle 'SIGKILL' also.
and tried to kill it from outside using 'kill -9 2557'.
it gets killed. means, you cant handle 'SIGKILL' in a program.


[ ] gcc example4.c 
[ ] ./a.out 
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2557
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2557
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2557
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2557
^CI won't die!

Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2557
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2557
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2557
Wasting CPU cycles. pid : 2557
Killed

============================================
Now lets try to write handler for 'SIGSEGV' (example5.c)


[ ] gcc example5.c
[ ] ./a.out

I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
I won't die!
Killed

Here, since we are handeling the SIGSEGV signal, it does not crash and stop.
rather it continusly tries to write data on the illegal memory. 

so we get so many of these prints. you just need to find the process id, and
kill the process.


============================================
SIGTERM vs SIGKILL: What's the Difference?

Both SIGTERM and SIGKILL are used for killing a process in Linux. But you should
prefer using SIGTERM.

By default, kill command sends the SIGTERM signal. You may explicitly mention it
with -15 but that’s redundant.

kill -15 <pid>
kill -TERM <pid>
kill <pid>

All the above commands do the same.

The SIGTERM can also be referred as a soft kill because the process that
receives the SIGTERM signal may choose to ignore it.

The SIGKILL is used for immediate termination of a process. This signal cannot
be ignored or blocked. The process will be terminated along with its threads
(if any).

You can use the option -9 to send the SIGKILL signal with the kill command and
kill the process immediately.

kill -9 <pid>

difference:
----------
Though both of these signals are used for killing a process, there are some
differences between the two:

SIGTERM gracefully kills the process (give a chance to the process to complete
its work and then exit) whereas SIGKILL kills the process immediately.

SIGTERM signal can be handled, ignored, and blocked, but SIGKILL cannot be
handled or blocked.

SIGTERM doesn’t kill the child processes. SIGKILL kills the child processes as
well.
